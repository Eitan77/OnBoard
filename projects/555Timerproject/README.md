# YOUR PROJECT NAME
555 Timer Circuit 

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My project is a 555-based timer circuit. The timing component is displayed through a series of LEDs which flash or "chase" in sequence to demonstrate the frequency of the clock. 

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It will cost 27 dollars. 

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I used easyEDA, and followed an in-class tutorial.
